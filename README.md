# musDS

## Description
This is my yt-dlp wrapper and music metadata manager. There is no gui and no plans to implement one, only a cli.

## Dependencies

#### Required: 

[Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) versions 3.11+ (tested with 3.11 and 3.13), other versions may or may not work.

[yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp), [dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv), [mutagen](https://github.com/quodlibet/mutagen)
```
python3 -m pip install -U yt-dlp dotenv mutagen
```

[ffmpeg and ffprobe binary](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)

#### Optional but highly recommended:

[yt-dlp-ejs](https://github.com/yt-dlp/ejs) and deno (or other js runtime see [wiki](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/EJS))
```
python3 -m pip install -U "yt-dlp[default]"
```

## Usage

Copy the example files to their actual paths:
```
cp example.env .env
cp example.yt-dlp.conf yt-dlp.conf
```

Fill in path to ffmpeg and ffprobe binary in yt-dlp.conf. Keep all paths in yt-dlp.conf absolute and dont use ~. If you are using yt-dlp-ejs uncomment --js-runtimes in yt-dlp.conf and put the program and path to the binary.

Fill in MUS_BASE_FOLDER in .env

Optional fields in .env

* MUS_DEFAULT_PLAYLIST: if default playlist for print, making this command work `python3 mus.py print`
* MUS_BITRATE: default bitrate is 128k, settings this will overide that in audio downloads"

download() and search() will be chosen based on if the first argument is part of SUB_FOLDERS.

Folder structure:
```
Base Folder
+-- subfolder 1
|   +-- file1.mp3
|   +-- file2.mp3
|   +-- other files.whatever
+-- subfolder 2
|   +-- file1.mp4
|   +-- file2.mp4
|   +-- other files.whatever
+-- other folders
|   +-- other files.whatever
+-- other files.whatever

```

### download
```
python3 /path/to/mus.py <subfolder> <url> <extra yt-dlp arguments>
```

Youtube videos, playlists, albums, shows, and twitch streams are all accepted. Both the full url and just the identifier work.

#### Examples:
```
# All 3 will download the same video and nothing else, everything after the first "&" is removed
$ python3 mus.py d "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVs0EdiVefM&list=PL9-3uiALO7exa6aF5as-bmK5qSFg30OUo&index=20"

$ python3 mus.py d "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVs0EdiVefM"

$ python3 mus.py d "rVs0EdiVefM"


# Both will download the entire playlist generating an error file in logs/
$ python3 mus.py d "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9-3uiALO7exa6aF5as-bmK5qSFg30OUo"

$ python3 mus.py d "PL9-3uiALO7exa6aF5as-bmK5qSFg30OUo"

# only download the 1,2,3 videos in the playlist
$ python3 mus.py d "PL9-3uiALO7exa6aF5as-bmK5qSFg30OUo" "-I '1:3'"
```

### search
```
python3 /path/to/mus.py <search term> <options>
```

The search folder will be the first item in the MUSD_FOLDERS list. The search term is case insensitive. If you want to search for a subfolder name, use "search" as the first argument and shift everything over.

#### Options:
```
t - title         - search through titles instead of file names
a - artist        - search through artists instead of file names
A - album         - search through albums instead of file names
R - hard remove   - remove term anywhere in the name
r - soft remove   - remove only if term is at the beginning or end
e - ends          - remove if and only if the first and last character match
b - backup        - write every file in the folder to a file in dname/
f - found         - write every file with the search term in the folder to a file in dfound/
l - length        - calculate lengths and display at the end
s - status        - display count, would-remove count, total and average size, 
                    and total and average length if selected
h - help          - display this message
```

#### Examples:
```
# searchs through file names in SUB_FOLDERS[0] for "search term" and prints them
$ python3 mus.py "search term"

# searches through titles instead of file names
$ python3 mus.py "search term" t

# search for a subfolder name in file titles
$ python3 mus.py search subfolder t

# removes "rep" from beginning and end of file names
$ python3 mus.py rep r
    REP_REP_stuff.mp3 -> _REP_stuff.mp3
    REP_stuff_REP.mp3 -> _stuff_.mp3

# removes "rep" from beginning and end of titles
$ python3 mus.py rep tr
    REP_REP_stuff -> _REP_stuff
    REP_stuff_REP -> _stuff_

# Also automatically removes leading or trailing spaces
$ python3 mus.py "multi word" r
    multi word something else.mp3 -> something else.mp3
    something else multi word.mp3 -> something else.mp3

# Replaces double spaces after removal with single spaces (see 2nd)
$ python3 mus.py rep R
    stuff_REP_stuff.mp3 -> stuff__stuff.mp3
    stuff REP stuff.mp3 -> stuff stuff.mp3
    REP_REP_stuff.mp3 -> __stuff.mp3
    REP_stuff_REP.mp3 -> _stuff_.mp3

$ python3 mus.py [middle_is_ignored] er
    [stuff].mp3 -> stuff.mp3
    [ stuff ].mp3 -> stuff.mp3
```

## Bugs
Youtube show url length keeps changing, use the full url for them. Playlists also sometimes have different lengths?. If you find one or want something added tell me in person.
